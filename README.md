# Python Portfolio - Jupyter Notebooks

## 1. Introduction  
Welcome to my Python portfolio! This repository showcases my Python programming skills through a collection of simple, fun, and interactive projects, such as games and utility programs. Each Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) contains easy-to-understand Python code that demonstrates my approach to problem-solving in a variety of programming scenarios.

The projects included in this portfolio range from classic games like Rock, Paper, Scissors and quiz games to practical programs like a shopping cart system.
## 2. How to Run the Code  
You can easily run the code from this repository using Google Colab, which allows you to execute the notebooks directly in your browser without any setup required. To do so:

1. Click on any `.ipynb` file in the repository.
2. Inside the notebook, click the **"Open in Colab"** button or follow the provided link to open it in Google Colab.
3. Once in Colab, click the **"Run"** button (the play icon) at the top of each code cell to execute the code and test the functionality.

No additional setup is neededâ€”all necessary libraries are already included in the notebooks.
